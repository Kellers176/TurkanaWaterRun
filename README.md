# TurkanaWaterRun
This the second project in my Production class that my team made. I was the only programmer on the team along with two designers, two artists, and one producer.

Turkana Water Run is a 2D Broken Age styled soft shaded side-view point-and-click adventure game in which one player takes on the role of a child from the Turkana people of Northwestern Kenya. The player must guide the child to a water jump away from the village, where they must then fill up the child's jug with as much water they can carry and return to the village so that they can feed their family's cattle. Controls are limited to the mouse, which the player uses to move around the game's play-space and interact with various different things, such as objects and people. The target market for this game is targeted to individuals between the ages of 28-45.
